Hello, you've arrived to the main repository for my website ([lucasmarino.me](https://lucasmarino.me)).

It's a simple and light, and that's why it's also super fast. 
Currently I host it on GitHub Pages, with cloudflare on front of that.

By the way, [Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucasmarino.me%2F) give it a 99 score on mobile and 100 on desktop, pretty neat.

Don't forget to check the [manifesto](https://lucasmarino.me/manifesto.html).
